# Data Folder

This is the folder where the data files (e.g. billing statements from TherapyNotes) are stored.

When you start the app for the first time, you'll be prompted to choose where you want this folder to be. A good place is a folder in OneDrive, so that the folder will sync to your other devices.

There's a button (folder icon) in the left sidebar that lets you choose a different folder, in case you ever need to move this folder.
